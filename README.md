## Some things you need to know

These are notes about conventions in this README.md. You might want to make yourself acquainted with them if this is your first visit.

<details>

<summary>:heavy_exclamation_mark: A note about proper configuration formatting. Click to expand!</summary>

The following documentation will refer to all configuration parameters in TOML format and with the assumption of a configuration file for your project at `/config.toml`. There are various formats of configurations (TOML/YAML/JSON) and multiple locations your configuration can reside (config file or config directory). Note that in the case of a config directory the section headers of all samples need to have the respective section title removed. So `[params.dnb.something]` will become `[dnb.something]` if the configuration is done in the file `/config/$CONFIGNAME/params.toml`.

## Installing

First enable modules in your own repository:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/username/reponame
```

Then add this module to your required modules in config.toml.

```toml
[module]

[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-errors"

```

The next time you run `hugo` it will download the latest version of the module.

## Updating

```shell
# update this module
hugo mod get -u github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-errors
# update all modules
hugo mod get -u ./...
```
